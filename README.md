# hello-worlds
Just getting Started! 
My name is Tica and I am learning to code so that I can work remotely and travel the world while making enough money to take care of myself. 
The places I would love to go are all over Africa and be a part of the amazing start up eneregy there. 
I would also like to go to Eastern Europe specifically to improve my Russian
I would also like to spend time in South American with the specific intention of learning how to speak Spanish!!
Isnt it funny that learning all of these coding languages will help me find the freedom to go learn more languages?
